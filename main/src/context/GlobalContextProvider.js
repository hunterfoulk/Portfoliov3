                summary: "I was approached by my good friends over at Apex Performance Facility a gym franchise here in Arizona to help design and build their new training software that would help them easily keep track of client appointments, progress, and performance. To Start, I designed the landing page with multiple components using TailwindCSS and HTML 5. Next I dove in to the fundamentals of the application experimenting with NextJS's server side rendering and image components for the best possible client performance I could achieve. I personally think NodeJS and MySQL are the most scalable easy to set up server and database enviroments out there so I decided to choose them for the back end enviroment along with TypeScript for type safety on the server. Overall this project was a huge success and one of the most fun pieces of work I've ever had the chance of working on! ",
